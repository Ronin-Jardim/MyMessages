# MyMessages

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.0.6.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. To connect to the database open server.js in the terminal and run `nodemon server.js`. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

# ABOUT

This progect was created to help with my understanding of how MEAN stack works. 
On the frontend i chose a simple approach to focus more on the logic side then the design side. I used Angular Material for this and a bit of custom css.

On the backend i tried to keep it simple by using my knowledge of crud and incorperated some more complicated things from a course to learn something new e.g File upload and mime types.

This application is my second attempt at mastering CRUD and is my second fullstack application.

#WHAT TO EXPECT
In the next version i plan to add a login/signup functionality and possibly work a bit more on the ui.
